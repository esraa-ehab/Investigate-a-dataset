## Introduction
> The dataset collects information
from 100k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.<br>
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on
what day the patient set up their
appointment. <br>
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the
location of the hospital. <br>
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates
whether or not the patient is
enrolled in Brasilian welfare
program Bolsa Família. <br><br>
<b> The Questions: </b>
1. What factors are
important for us to
know in order to
predict if a patient will
show up for their
scheduled
appointment?
2. Comparison between the impact that happens as a result for the age and the received SMS
  * What is the impact on the attendance rate when changing ages?
  * What is the impact on the attendance rate when changing the number of received SMS?
3. How can we see the difference between Alcoholism and Diabetes?
